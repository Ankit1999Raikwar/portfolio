            <p class="blog-content" >  Routing and switching are the basic functions of network communication. ... The function of Switching is to switch data packets between devices on the same network (or same LAN - Local Area Network). The function of Routing is to Route packets between different networks 
                (between different LANs - Local Area Networks ,Routing Protocols are the set of defined rules used by the routers to communicate between source & destination. They do not move the information to the source to a destination, but only update the routing table that contains the information.

                Network Router protocols helps you to specify way routers communicate with each other. It allows the network to select routes between any two nodes </br>
                <h3 class="blog-heading2">Types of Routing Protocols </h3>
                 <p class="blog-content">                 There are mainly two types of Network Routing Protocols</p>
                 <h4 class="blog-heading2">Staic Routing Protocol</h4>
                 <p class="blog-content" style="margin-top: 8px;"> As previously stated, static routes are widely used in networks today. Static routes are used in networks of all sizes, and are used along with a dynamic routing protocol.
                     For this reason, a good understanding of static routes is a requirement for implementing routing on a network.</p>
                     <h4 class="blog-heading2">Dynamic Routing Protocol</h4>
                     <p class="blog-content" style="margin-top: 8px;">This paper presents th implementation decisions to be made when th choice is between protocols that involve distance vector or link state or the combination of both. Here a comparison is made between different parameters and a detailed simulation study is performed on the network with different routing 
                    protocols and it has been shown that EIGRP provides a better network convergence time, less bandwidth requirements and better CPU and memory utilization compared to OSPF and RIP. EIGRP, OSPF and RIP are the dynamic routing protocols being
                     used in the practical networks to propagat network topology information to the neighboring routers. There have been a large
                     number of static and dynamic routing protocols available but choice of the right protocol for routing is dependent on many parameters critical being network convergence time, scalability,
                     memory and CPU requirements, security and bandwidth requirement etc.</p>
