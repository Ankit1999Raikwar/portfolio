            <p class="blog-content" >Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. 
                Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly.
                h Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce 
                the delay between writing code and running it in production

                <h3 class="blog-heading2">Docker container </h3>
                <p class="blog-content">In other words, a Docker image runs the code in the Docker container. Everything that’s needed to perform a complete task is in the image, but it becomes functional once it is executed within a container. The image may be used once or multiple times. 

 

                    While separate image layers may have different purposes, Docker containers are formed to carry out single, specific tasks. That is one reason why typically a Docker image has several layers of files that perform different jobs. They work together to achieve the primary objective of the Docker container.</p> 

                
              
                <h4 class="blog-heading2"> what is docker image</h4>
                <p class="blog-content">A Docker image is the set of processes outlined in the Docker file. It is helpful to think of these as templates created by the Docker files. These are arranged in layers automatically. Each layer is dependent on the layer below it. Each layer then becomes more abstracted than the layer below.

 

                    By abstracting the actual “instructions” (remember the Docker files?), an environment that can function with its resources isolated is created. While virtual machines relied on calling OS level resources, containers have eliminated this. In turn, this creates a lightweight and highly scalable system. IronWorker takes these images and begins the process of creating and orchestrating complete containers. 
                    
                     
                    
                    You can create a docker image by using an existing image and updating its file components for the present container. You can also create the docker image from scratch through the use of a Dockerfile you construct. </p> 
                    <h4 class="blog-heading2"> what is docker file</h4>
                    <p class="blog-content">Let’s keep it simple. Docker files are configuration files that “tell” Docker images what to install, update, etc. Basically the Docker file says what to build that will be the Docker image. These files have everything to eventually build a container. The types of files include dependencies, application code, installations, and everything else that is needed to execute effectively.

                    <p class="blog-content">To understand Docker Compose, let’s look at Myntra as an example. Myntra is a fashion e-commerce website similar to Amazon. You visit the Myntra website through your web browser and go through several activities, like logging in to your account, browsing a catalog, checking out, and so on. Behind each of these activities or services are different products, such as an account database, product database, cart database, and others that run behind the scenes</p>
